1. Configure RMAN to use the flash recovery area.
	DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST = '/u01/oracle/fra'
	DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST_SIZE = 2G
	
2. RMAN Usage Considerations
	- Privileges given to users:
		– Database: SYSDBA
		– Operating system: Access to devices
	- Remote operations:
		– Set up the password file
		– Ensure that the password file is backed up 
3. Starting
	- Starting RMAN locally
		- Windows NT: 	C:\> set ORACLE_SID=DB01
				C:\> rman target /<sysdba or user same sysdba>@<db_name>
			exp: 	C:\>rman target sys@orcl

	- Starting RMAN remotely
		rman target sys/password@DB01
